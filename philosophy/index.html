    <h2>Philosophy</h2><p>Intra Space Design means within the space. As someone who has wanted to design since a small child my passion has never subsided to create inspiring, innovative environments that improve the world in which we work and live. I do my utmost to thoughtfully listen to my clients needs and try to resolve issues or problems that they desire to change. To me a designer is someone who solves problems a space Dr. of sorts. Sometimes a designer helps put the pieces of the puzzle together. When need be, I call on other specialists to assist in creating the best possible project for the client.</p><p>My mission is to&nbsp;<strong>deliver the client's goals and objectives by creating efficient, ergonomically correct spaces, utilizing sustainable products, building a functional environment that is of course beautiful and works.</strong> Intra Space Design is dedicated to giving back to the community and is involved with pro bono work and volunteering for organizations at home and abroad.</p><p>I am the Principal Designer at Intra Space Design, llc. which began in southern California in the early 1990&rsquo;s and has continued in west Michigan for the last 12 years.</p></div>
